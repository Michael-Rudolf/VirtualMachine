# Virtual Machine
# Depracated (see repo "Stupid-RISC Virtual Machine" for a newer version.
## A rust-powered project that suppports my *"Stupid RISC"* instruction set.

You can find the Stupid RISC instruction set under https://github.com/Michael-Rudolf/Stupid-RISC-instruction-set.

## Execution
You can open an (Stupid RISC 0.0.2) assembly file just by executing the file. This will convert it to binary & execute it step by step.
